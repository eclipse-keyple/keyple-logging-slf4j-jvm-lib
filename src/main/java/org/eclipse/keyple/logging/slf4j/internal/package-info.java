/**
 * Internal implementation of the Keyple logging API using SLF4J.
 *
 * <p>This package contains the internal classes that provide the SLF4J-based implementation of the
 * Keyple logging framework. It bridges the Keyple logging API with SLF4J, allowing applications to
 * use their preferred logging backend (Logback, Log4j, etc.) through SLF4J.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> This package is internal and should not be used directly by client applications.
 * Use the public API provided by the Keyple logging module instead.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
