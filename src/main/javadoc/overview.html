<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    This library provides an SLF4J-based implementation of the Keyple logging API.
    It allows Keyple components to integrate seamlessly with the Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J),
    enabling applications to use their preferred logging backend such as Logback, Log4j2, or java.util.logging.
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
    The Keyple Logging SLF4J library serves as a bridge between the Keyple logging framework and SLF4J.
    By using this implementation, developers can leverage the flexibility of SLF4J to configure and manage
    logging across their Keyple-based applications according to their specific requirements and existing
    logging infrastructure.
</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Seamless integration with SLF4J logging facade</li>
    <li>Support for all SLF4J-compatible logging backends</li>
    <li>Consistent logging behavior across Keyple components</li>
    <li>Easy configuration through standard SLF4J mechanisms</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    To use this library, simply include it as a dependency in your project along with your chosen SLF4J
    implementation (e.g., Logback, Log4j2). The Keyple logging framework will automatically detect and
    use this SLF4J implementation.
</p>

<h2>Package Structure</h2>
<p>
    This library contains a single internal package:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>org.eclipse.keyple.logging.slf4j.internal</code> - Internal implementation classes for SLF4J integration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Internal API:</strong> The classes in this library are internal implementation details and should
    not be used directly by client applications. They are subject to change without notice. Applications should
    interact with the Keyple logging framework through the public API provided by the core Keyple logging module.
